At the time of Dora Keens ascent, the true summit elevation of Mount Blackburn was unknown. The routes out of the Kennicott Glacier are no longer doable due to climate change.

Climbing is very undeveloped, but potential for new routes is endless.  Climbing is mostly one to two pitch routes on granite or bouldering.  Boulder fields are extensive, steep and high quality granite.  Most faces are sporadically featured with edges, slopers, jugs and cracks.  Route potential exists on both sides of the river, with crack and face climbing in quantities approaching 1000 potential routes or more.  Bouldering is located primarily in two talus fields, with some rock spread intermittently below the first field.  Lower talus is located at approximately 1.5 miles north of Sheep camp and the upper talus is another 1/2 mile up the trail.  Potential could exist beyond the upper talus field however it is limited and quality of rock decreases. Area marked as alpine, as weather can frequently turn poor in very little time and access is relatively remote. No services at location, filter all water and be bear aware. For all willing and adventurous Alaskan climbers, this is the motherlode of cragging and bouldering in Alaska.
