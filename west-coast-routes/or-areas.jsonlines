The view takes in much of the eastern slope, the extent of Springer Ridge, and parts of central Oregon. It's a wildflower and bird sanctuary during the spring and fall, though the southern aspect means it's baking in the summer. Boulders of various sizes and shapes sprout out of the gently sloping hillside, growing in size as you head downhill, until they become veritable cliffs of 35-40'.", " Bouldering has historically been the main attraction, as there are several areas nearby with better roped climbing potential. There are dozens upon dozens of problems to do, from low-ball traverses to high-ball slabs to juggy overhangs. The boulders are also tightly packed and each feature hosts many different problems. The rock is quite gritty and sometimes flaky, but overall high-quality and high-friction. Some of the high ball features have bolts on top to dial in your sequence before you go for the send.", " The cliffs are generally short, but the features are quite striking. This makes it a pretty ideal beginner's area as the necessary gear is minimal: just a rope, a cordelette or long sling, some lockers, a harness, and shoes are all you'll need to have a fun weekend out here. All top anchors are fairly accessible with, at most, a little scrambling or a hop from one rock to another. A few new top anchors have appeared recently, though none of these have fixed hardware for lowering or rappelling. Just retrieve your anchor when you're done and move on to the next feature that calls to you.", " This area appears to be popular with local campers, as there is an established but non-\"developed\" campsite with fire ring and log benches. Please practice LNT and pack out all garbage, even if it's not yours. Be wary of wandering off the social trails as the soil is quite fragile here and the flowers bring so much beauty to the area.

From the summit register you'll have a view of Mt. Thielsen and Bailey.There are 10 establish routes ranging from 5.6 to 5.10d. The rock is very coarse grained providing excellent friction. The closes description of the texture I can think of for comparison is the quartz monzonite at Joshua Tree. Totally different rocks with similar texture.For the most part routes are bolted in 1980's \"alpine\" style with an average distance between bolts of about 10 feet and 50 m pitches. The two exceptions are Terminator which is a 30 m sport route with an average bolt spacing of about 6 feet, and a traditional crack climb on the first pitch (5.8) of Testosterone Monkey with gear placements from 1 to 4 inches. Note that the first 50 feet of routes on the east side of the south face can be a little mossy, particularly on the shaddowy start of Wipeout and Easy Street which are more to the SE. Once dry the moss becomes less of a factor, but is fun to climb anyway.If this is your first time to McKinley Rock I would recommend beginning on Easy Street (5.8 G) by way of Wilding-101 (5.10a G) or Hang Ten (5.10a PG13). PG = exposure and leads generally may be unsuited to someone transitioning from gym to outdoor climbing at the same rating.Descent: rappel from the register either ~80 ft down the backside (N) and a steep scramble, or a recommended 350 feet in three and a half 30 m rappels down the south side.
